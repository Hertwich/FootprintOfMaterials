Carbon and other footprints of materials

MatLab scripts generated to calculate the carbon and other footprints of materials using an MRIO database such as EXIOBASE in the EORA-NTNU Matpack format.
Created by Edgar Hertwich using MATLAB R2018a, during the course of 2018 and spring 2019. The EXIOBASE version used here is not public due to the use of proprietary third-party data. A public version of EXIOBASE is available at https://zenodo.org/record/3583071 

The mathematical methods implemented here are described in https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n9ecw/. Please cite that manuscript when referring to this code.
